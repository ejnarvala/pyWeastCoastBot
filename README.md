# pyWeastCoastBot

This project is the python version of WeastCoastBot because my friends are picky and don't like nodejs

# Getting Started
## Requirements
* Docker

## Local Development

1. Create a `.env` file in `/bot` by copying `.env.example` and populating the variables with your values
2. Start up the app by running `docker-compose up --bulid`
   * this will run db migrations and hot reload for any code changes
3. Start coding!
